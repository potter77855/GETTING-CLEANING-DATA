Code Book
NOTE:  Author of run_analysis is 71 year-old former COBOL programmer so longer data names used plus capital letters used
run_analysis script used to do followng:
1) Merge training & test sets to create 1 data set
2) extracts only measurements on mean & standard deviation 
    for each measurement
NOTE: descriptive activity names used for activities in merged 
           data set
NOTE: appropriately label merged data set with descriptive 
           variable names
3) from merged data set, creates 2nd independent tidy data set 
    with the average of each variable for each activity & each subject
Data
This project is an exercise in acquiring and cleaning data
Processing
Step 1: load dplyr as package need for several steps
Step 2: set up steps for getting file GCDFILE to start working with
A) set GCDFILE as zip file in authors area
B) check to see if GCDFILE does not exist until download made
C) set GCDURL to http address of data to download
D) download file
E) unzip GCDFILE

Step 3: Assign names to each of the 8 data frames (column heading
             also added)

1) UHDFEATS   for “features.txt"
2) UHDACTS     for “activity_labels.txt"
3) UHDTEST_S  for “subject_test.txt"
4) UHDTEST_X  for “test/x_test.txt"
5) UHDTEST_Y  for “test/y_test.txt"
6) UHDTRAIN_S  for “subject_train.txt"
7) UHDTRAIN_X  for “train/x_train.txt"
8) UHDTRAIN_Y  for “train/y_train.txt"

NOTE:
FEATNAMES created as list of UHDFEATS FUNCTIONS

Step 4: Combine data by rows for x, y & subject

A) CTTX row bind of UHDTEST_X & UHDTRAIN_X
B) CTTY row bind of UHDTEST_Y & UHDTRAIN_Y
C) CTTS row bind of UHDTEST_S & UHDTRAIN_S
Step 5: Merge by columns combined data sets of x, y & subject

MSYX column bind of CTTS, CTTX & CTTY

Step 6: Using the merge data set, create data set with ‘mean’ &    
            ‘standard deviation’ 

ONLYNEED created from MSYX with selecting SUBJECT & CODE with 
            ‘mean’ & standard deviation

Step 7: give descriptive names to the activites in just created data set
NOTE: full names of activites made

Step 8: get activity name (example: walking) for final data set
            A) UHDACTS as a tibble (UHDACTTBL)
            B) join ONLYNEED with UHDACTTBL by common column
                to create UHDACTJOIN  
            C) add column to UHDACTJOIN
            D) select UHDACTJOIN without 2nd column  
       

Step 8: create a final data set from prior created data set that is
             grouped by subject & activity & summarized by ‘mean’ of all
            activites

LASTNEED created from UHDACTJOIN group_by(SUBJECT, ACTIVITY) 
            with summarizing all (means) 

Step 9: final data set written out to table to ‘finalData.txt’
